# Cloud Assessment

Build and deploy a very simple GitHub Action workflow that scans container images for vulnerabilities

1.  Users can create issues on your repo containing a list of container images to be scrutinized
2.  Your repo needs to take that list, scan the images for vulnerabilities and create a comment on the original issue with the outcome of the scan, stating which image(s) are safe or unsafe
3.  Close the issue to trigger evaluating your work/attempt on the challenge
